# Coronavirous Research and Insights Share
Epidemic prediction and estimation of 2019-nCoV

#### Date: Since Jan 26 2020

***
### Goals: (draft)
1. Translate the statistical models in the publihsed paper into python.
   - Update/track by new (real-time) data.
   - Compare with the reality: understanding models' limitation.
   - Try to improve model's estimation/prediction/inference further.
1. Build dashboard for real-time visualisation.
1. Insights sharing
