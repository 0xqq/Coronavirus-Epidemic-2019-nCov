### Goal: (draft)
1. Translate the statistical models in the publihsed paper into python.
   - Learn how to apply statistical knowledge to applcation. 
   - Update/track by new (real-time) data. 
   - Compare with improved model later on: understanding models' limitation.
2. Try to improve model estimation/prediction by ourselves. 
3. Build dashboard for real-time visualisation. 
4. Insights sharing
